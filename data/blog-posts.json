    "content": "Carlos Rodgarman is a renowned music producer based in Los Angeles, celebrated for his ability to blend digital and analog production techniques in cutting-edge hybrid setups. His meticulous approach to mixing and his skill in leveraging high-end equipment like the Neve Genesis Black console have positioned him as an industry leader in Los Angeles' vibrant music scene.\n<h3>Innovation in Music Production</h3>\nCarlos Rodgarman is a pioneer in integrating analog console equipment with advanced digital technology. In his Los Angeles studio, he combines effects and reverb in both “in-the-box” and “out-the-box” configurations, creating high-quality mixes that highlight the authenticity and depth of each track. His precise automation capabilities allow Rodgarman to experiment and fine-tune effects, ensuring absolute control over the texture and atmosphere of every musical piece.\n<h3>Advanced Workflow Solutions</h3>\nFor Rodgarman, each music production is an opportunity to innovate. A prime example is his strategic use of the Neve Genesis Black console, which enables him to fine-tune effect sends on each track. Through this methodology, he achieves a dynamic structure and unique spatial feel in every mix, capturing the essence of each artist.\n\nCarlos’ ability to implement complex workflows, such as duplicating vocal tracks and efficiently assigning effects on the tape return, sets his projects apart. These production techniques ensure that each instrument, vocal, or effect finds its ideal space within the final mix, bringing the music to life in the listener’s ears.\n<h3>Collaborations with Artists and Cutting-Edge Technology</h3>\nCarlos collaborates with some of the industry’s most influential artists, adapting his style to enhance each project's unique qualities. His experience with software like SoundFlow and Bounce Factory allows him to print stems (individual sound layers) with precision, streamlining the production process without compromising quality. This enhances the review and adjustment phases, optimizing collaboration and consistently exceeding the expectations of the artists he works with.\n<h3>Simple Explanation of Carlos Rodgarman’s Workflow Solution with the Neve Genesis Black Console</h3>\nHi everyone, I’m Carlos Roggman! I wanted to share a quick solution I found for my hybrid setup, where I mix analog and digital processing on a Neve Genesis Black console.\n\nIn a hybrid setup, I can control most functions, like EQ and dynamics, with automation, but sending effects like reverb isn’t as straightforward. To solve this, I route the effect send (like reverb) to a submaster. By duplicating the vocal track, I can manage the effect amount on a separate fader without impacting the main signal. This gives me full control over how much reverb is applied to the vocal.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUYLPVyWg-w\n\nThe Genesis Control plugin also lets me manage effects for each channel, so I can automate both the main (dry) and effect (wet) signals independently. If you’re using tools like SoundFlow or Bounce Factory to print stems, this approach makes exporting simple—allowing you to print the dry vocal and effects without any hassle.\n\nHope you find this helpful!\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nCarlos Rodgarman stands out in Los Angeles not only for his technical expertise but for his passion for music production and commitment to excellence. If you're looking for a music producer who brings quality, creativity, and innovation to your music, Carlos Rodgarman is the ideal choice in Los Angeles.",

A 7370A subwoofer is matched to the LCR array and a 7350A sub is matched to the surround and overhead speakers.</p>\n\n<p>Gatica has produced six of Bublé’s last LPs, all of which were Grammy-nominated and four of which won their respective categories. Most of the recordings, which date back to 2006’s&nbsp;It’s Time, were also originally mixed on Genelec 1031A and 1032A speakers, the same ones Gatica — who has also won Grammys for his recordings and mixes of Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” and Chicago’s album&nbsp;17&nbsp;— has used for three decades.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mixonline.com/recording/facilities/mansion-sound-unveils-new-ssl-genelec-outfitted-studios\"><strong>Mansion Sound Unveils New SSL, Genelec-Outfitted Studios</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>“I’m still using my original 1031s for mixing to this day,” Gatica says. “I cannot imagine recording and mixing without them. Wherever in the world I was recording, if I needed to, I’d fly in some 1031s! So naturally, for Michael’s first Atmos mixes, we had to work on Genelecs.”</p>\n\n<p>“Between the sound of the Genelecs and the technology, like the GLM automatic calibration, this was a no-brainer for the project with Humberto and Michael,” says Rodgarman, a native of Galicia, Spain, who has recorded, arranged and produced for artists including vocal trio The Serenad3, Juan Gabriel and the Afro-Peruvian Jazz Orchestra. “The GLM did an excellent job of calibrating the entire Atmos speaker array, but even for stereo work, I’ve come to rely more and more on the Genelecs.”</p>\n\n<p>“The Genelec monitoring here is a big reason why Carlos and I decided to work together on this project,” Gatica says. “When you’re confident in the way things sound, when you know the direction you’re going is right, then you can start to begin to polish and reshape the sounds and really get into it. The Genelecs are able to fully reproduce the musicality of the instrumentation and the vocals.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>News source:</strong> https://www.mixonline.com/</p>",

He also took the opportunity install the Neve <a href=\"https://www.ams-neve.com/genesyscontrol-plugin-199-w.asp\">GenesysControl Plugin</a> and Neve 88R EQ hardware.<br /><br /> “To say I am blown away by this console is an understatement,” Rodgarman says. “The combination of <a href=\"https://www.ams-neve.com/neve-genesys-black-console-56-p.asp\">Genesys Black</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ams-neve.com/genesyscontrol-plugin-199-w.asp\">GenesysControl</a> has completely revolutionised the way I work.

It is transformative – just saying I have a Neve console is impressive because my clients understand the brand’s audio quality and pedigree.”<br /><br />Originally from Spain, Rodgarman moved to America 18 years ago to pursue a career as a musician. As a talented pianist, he worked with many artists including Celine Dion, All - 4 - One, Prince Royce, Jonathan Butler, Sheila E, La India and many more. He is also in demand as a producer, arranger, musical director and programmer and now spends most of his time in the studio , where he has worked with artists such as Juan Gabriel, Beto Cuevas, Jenni Rivera, producer Humberto Gatica, Laura Bretan, Cristian Castro, Isabel Pantoja, Antonio Carmona and Oskar Cartay a, whose latest project was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

The desk is also built to last and that was important as I was looking for reliability.”<br /><br />Rodgarman adds that the modular nature of Genesys Black was also attractive because i t allowed him scope to expand in the future.<br /><br />“What I didn’t realise was just how quickly I would want to do that.,” he says “As soon as I started using it, I got so much pleasure from tracking through the desk that I wanted to do more and more on it, which meant I needed extra channels. The addition of GenesysControl has also changed the way I work. I can now move seamlessly between Pro Tools or Logic and the console, and it is also much quicker to switch from project to project because sessions can be set up so easily by simply pushing a few buttons.”<br /><br />A speedier workflow proved especially beneficial in the run up to Christmas 2019 as Carlos Rodgarman was busy finishing a new album with Beto Cuevas , as well working on two major Christmas concerts that involved large orchestras.<br /><br />“I’m hoping to have more time for my own projects next year,” he says. “I’m keen to develop a music library and there are also a couple of interesting film projects in the pipeline, which will keep my Neve Genesys Black console busy.”</p>\n<p>Article source:<a href=\"https://www.ams-neve.com/\"> https://www.ams-neve.com/</a></p></div>\n\n<!-- {\"type\":\"layout\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"section\",\"props\":{\"style\":\"default\",\"width\":\"default\",\"vertical_align\":\"middle\",\"title_position\":\"top-left\",\"title_rotation\":\"left\",\"title_breakpoint\":\"xl\",\"image_position\":\"center-center\",\"text_color\":\"\",\"width_expand\":\"\",\"height\":\"\",\"padding\":\"\",\"header_transparent\":\"\",\"animation\":\"\"},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"row\",\"props\":{\"layout\":\"1-1\",\"breakpoint\":\"m\",\"fixed_width\":\"large\",\"column_gap\":\"\",\"row_gap\":\"\",\"width\":\"\",\"width_expand\":\"\",\"height\":\"\",\"margin\":\"\"},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"column\",\"props\":{\"image_position\":\"center-center\",\"media_overlay_gradient\":\"\",\"vertical_align\":\"\",\"style\":\"\",\"text_color\":\"\",\"padding\":\"\"},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"headline\",\"props\":{\"title_element\":\"h1\",\"title_style\":\"\",\"title_decoration\":\"\",\"title_font_family\":\"\",\"title_color\":\"\",\"position\":\"\",\"position_z_index\":\"\",\"margin\":\"\",\"maxwidth\":\"\",\"maxwidth_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align\":\"\",\"block_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align_fallback\":\"\",\"text_align\":\"\",\"text_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"text_align_fallback\":\"\",\"animation\":\"\",\"visibility\":\"\",\"content\":\"<h1>Carlos Rodgarman Adds Prestige To His Studio By Installing A Genesys Black<br \\/>\\u00a0<\\/h1>\"}},{\"type\":\"image\",\"props\":{\"margin\":\"default\",\"image_svg_color\":\"emphasis\",\"link_target\":\"\",\"image_border\":\"\",\"image_box_shadow\":\"\",\"image_hover_box_shadow\":\"\",\"image_box_decoration\":\"\",\"position\":\"\",\"position_z_index\":\"\",\"maxwidth\":\"\",\"maxwidth_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align\":\"\",\"block_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align_fallback\":\"\",\"text_align\":\"\",\"text_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"text_align_fallback\":\"\",\"animation\":\"\",\"visibility\":\"\",\"image\":\"wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/01\\/rodgarman_studio.jpg\"}},{\"type\":\"headline\",\"props\":{\"title_element\":\"h1\",\"title_style\":\"\",\"title_decoration\":\"\",\"title_font_family\":\"\",\"title_color\":\"\",\"position\":\"\",\"position_z_index\":\"\",\"margin\":\"\",\"maxwidth\":\"\",\"maxwidth_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align\":\"\",\"block_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align_fallback\":\"\",\"text_align\":\"\",\"text_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"text_align_fallback\":\"\",\"animation\":\"\",\"visibility\":\"\",\"content\":\"<h3><em>The renowned producer , composer and arranger is discovering so many benefits from working with AMS Neve technology that he has already expanded his console with additional channels<\\/em><\\/h3>\"}},{\"type\":\"text\",\"props\":{\"margin\":\"default\",\"column_breakpoint\":\"m\",\"text_style\":\"\",\"text_color\":\"\",\"text_size\":\"\",\"column\":\"\",\"position\":\"\",\"position_z_index\":\"\",\"maxwidth\":\"\",\"maxwidth_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align\":\"\",\"block_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"block_align_fallback\":\"\",\"text_align\":\"\",\"text_align_breakpoint\":\"\",\"text_align_fallback\":\"\",\"animation\":\"\",\"visibility\":\"\",\"content\":\"<p>You can never have too much of a good thing \\u2013 this was the conclusion producer and composer Carlos Rodgarman reached after adding an eight channel AMS <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.ams-neve.com\\/neve-genesys-black-console-56-p.asp\\\">Neve Genesys Black G16<\\/a> to his private studio in Los Angeles.\\u00a0<br \\/><br \\/>Within months of installing the desk, Rodgarman was so impressed by its power, flexibility and the way it streamlined his workflow that he upgraded the console to a G48 by adding a 16 channel expansion module.
